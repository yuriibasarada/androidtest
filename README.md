### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine.
- **Appium**: Make sure Appium server is running locally or on a remote machine.
- **WebDriverIO**: WebDriverIO is used for automating the tests. Install it using `npm install @wdio/cli`.

### Code Details

The provided code utilizes WebDriverIO to automate interactions with the Android device and the target application. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

- **Capabilities**: Define the capabilities required to launch and interact with the Android device and application.

- **toggleWifi(val)**: Function to toggle the Wi-Fi connection of the Android device. It connects/disconnects based on the `val` parameter (default is `false`).

- **launchAppAndGetResponse(appActivity, appPackage)**: Function to launch the specified Android application and retrieve the page source after a short pause.

- **runTest()**: Main function that orchestrates the test flow:
    - Toggles Wi-Fi off, launches the app, and logs the response.
    - Toggles Wi-Fi on, relaunches the app, and logs the response again.

### Running the Tests

1. **Setup**: Ensure Appium server is running and the Android device is connected.

2. **Configuration**: Update the `wdOpts` object in the code with your specific Appium server details (hostname and port) if they differ from the defaults.

3. **Execution**: Run the test script using `node <filename>.js` where `<filename>` is the name of your script file.

### Output

```sh
console.log()
```
